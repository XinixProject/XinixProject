## Welcome to the Xinix Project!
The purpose of this project is to provide a robust, valuable, and well-supported ecosystem of applications, and components to build applications, that support
one core tennet and our motto: "A culture of privacy." Some examples of projects you will find here include:

- Utilities to make system administration more straightforward for the developer who is not a full-time sysadmin
- Application frameworks that are based on principles of security, integrity, and an unfettered respect for personal autonomy and privacy
- Tools and utilities aimed at the developer-enthusiast, free of spam, bloat, spyware, and other garbage

We strongly encourage you to visit our GitHub repos often, as content is constantly growing and new repos are added all the time. If you are a developer and
would like to contribute, please feel free to jump in! Answers to many questions, and a general overview of the architecture and technical design of our
applications can be found in the Wikis. We likewise strongly encourage contributing developers to update the Wikis accordingly with any changes implemented.

The Xinix Project is largely sponsored and maintained by its original benefactor. Your financial support is greatly appreciated and goes a long way to supporting
some of the expenses that do come with maintaining a quality suite of software and utilities. If you find our projects useful and valuable, then please share them
and tell others about them. If you have the technical expertise, please contribute. If you can afford a financial contribution, please donate to us on Patreon.
Your financial support helps us produce not only content here, but also free trainer content on platforms such as YouTube and Vimmeo.
